1. What is the difference between "forEach" and ".map" ?

2. What is the difference between a function and a method
	- The primary differnce I have noticed is that Functions
	operate on their own outside of another block of code.
	- Methodes exist within classes,other functions and 
	objects.


3. What is closure?

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
	O- It goes in the following order..
	- Is the function called/used by using 'new'?
	- Has it been called by using call(),apply() or bind()?
	- Is it a method?
	- Has it been called as a global? Will you see "undefined"
	or will you see "window" by console logging 'this'?

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
